HISTORY:

In ZL, half of the sentence of Sequioa-6.0 (with even sentid) were imported.
The imported files are in folder 6.0.

In november 2015, annotation of these sentences were updated to Sequoia-7.0 data.
The file bonus_sequoia_7 contains the list of relation diff from 6.0 to 7.0

example: 
	Europar.550_00206	4	2	suj
means that the word 4 of "Europar.550_00206" changes in 7.0 to have word 2 as a governor with relation "suj".
